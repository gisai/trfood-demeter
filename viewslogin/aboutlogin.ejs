			<p>TrFood is an application created in Madrid (Spain), for product traceability. We believe in the importance of providing as much information as possible about the product to be consumed, because customers deserve to have the opportunity to know the essential data about the food they eat. Where the product has passed through, who distributes it, its nutritional information or even a figure close to the amount of Co2 Equivalent per kg of product expelled into the atmosphere.</p>
			<p>The platform has the ability to register users to add products, and edit them through permissions granted by the product administrator, or through access by a unique QR code only visible to the owner. In addition, users will only have to enter the identifier to access the product information. This identifier can be obtained through a QR code, or by looking directly at the product.</p>

				<h1 style="font-family: serif; font-size: 50px;">What is Food traceability?</h1>
				
				<p>Food traceability is the ability to follow the movement of a food product and its ingredients through all steps in the supply chain, both backward and forward. Traceability involves documenting and linking the production, processing, and distribution chain of food products and ingredients. In the case of a foodborne illness outbreak or contamination event, efficient product tracing helps government agencies and those who produce and sell food to rapidly find the source of the product and where contamination may have occurred. This enables faster removal of the affected product from the marketplace, reducing incidences of foodborne illnesses.</p>

			<p>Existing FDA regulations require much of the food industry to establish and maintain records that document one step forward to where food has gone and one step back to its immediate previous source. These requirements establish baseline traceability recordkeeping throughout much of the food system, but these records often prove insufficient to effectively and rapidly link shipments of food through each point in the supply chain. In addition, these existing FDA traceability requirements do not apply to farms and restaurants, meaning that a large part of the supply chain is excluded from keeping these important traceability records.  Simply put- the U.S. lacks a harmonized system of traceability from farm to fork that is universally understood and utilized. This means that during an outbreak investigation, our ability to rapidly track and trace food is often impeded by insufficient data identifying a food as it moved through its supply chain. A modern, coordinated approach to traceability that can be used and understood throughout all stages of the food supply chain will go further to reduce foodborne illness, build consumer trust, and avoid overly-broad recalls.</p>
